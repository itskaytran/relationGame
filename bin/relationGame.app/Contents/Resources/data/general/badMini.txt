b:I really thought better of you than that.
b:How could you say that to me?
b:Oh no, that won't be a good idea.
b:I'm definitely busy after this.
b:Are you kidding me?
b:That's awful.
b:Please back off.
b:I don't appreciate that.
b:Get out of my face.
b:You need to leave me alone.
b:I don't want to go out with you... ever.
b:This is going nowhere.
b:You really want to keep bothering me?
b:It would be great if you walked away now.
b:Oh wow, you're kind of terrible.
b:You're awfully forward.
b:Why are you trying so hard?
b:This isn't working.
b:Get away from me!
b:You're about as effective as a cat in a tree.
b:I told you not to say that!
b:Um... not really.
b:No one is appreciating this.
b:Be quiet.
b:Don't talk to me.
b:Please leave.
b:Stop talking to me.
b:I'm going to go talk with my friends now.
b:I'm going to go get another drink, don't follow me.
b:We are totally never going to hang out together.
b:Gonna just smack that offer of friendship off the table.
b:You really don't get it, do you?
b:If you think that, I think we're done talking.
b:This is a terrible way to make an impression.
b:You really just said that, didn't you?
b:Oh wow. No.
b:I'm not so thrilled to be here.
b:Do I look happy right now?
b:This conversation is over.
b:Don't bother.
b:I'm going to stop you right there.
b:You're very wrong.
b:No.
b:Ugh, no.
b:That's really not ok.
b:...
b:...stop.
b:Could you just not?
b:I have no words for how bad that was.
b:Oh god no.
b:Rude!
b:So rude!
b:I don't want to hear it.
b:Why would you do that?
b:*a shocked stare brimming with resentment*
b:Get out.
b:You are making me uncomfortable.
b:This is not ok.
b:No!
b:What did you say?!
b:I really don't like you.
b:Take that back.
b:Absolutely not.
