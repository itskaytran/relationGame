g:You know what we should do?
g:Thanks! I got them just the other day.
g:Oh you're so sweet for saying that.
g:I really want to tell you more about...
g:Did you see them yesterday too? Small world.
g:This is a really fun party, yeah?
g:Would you like another drink?
g:You should really meet my friends, they'd love you.
m:Do you really think so?
m:Are you sure about that?
m:Maybe we could talk about something happier....
m:I'm not sure about that but alright.
m:You always say the weirdest things.
m:My plans might be open...
m:Tomorrow? What's going on then?
m:I can never tell what you'll say next!
m:Please think about what you said.
m:Just yesterday you said you wouldn't.
m:What did you say to me?
m:I didn't know you felt that way.
m:Is that what you really wanted to say to me?
m:Maybe we should do a rain check...
m:Oh, that could be fun.
m:Are you feeling ok?
m:Let's go chat with our friends for now, ok?
m:You know I don't think that.
m:Oh sure, that might work again.
m:I can grab us some more drinks.
m:Oh, um... let me think on that, ok?
m:Did I catch you at a bad time?
m:Some people might approach it like that.
m:Oh god, that is one way to take it haha.
m:That is interesting...
m:Oh yeah, maybe!
m:Uh huh, oh yeah?
m:Haha, hold up a second there...
m:No wait, really?
m:I think I should check in on my friend
m:I'm going to grab another drink soon...
m:Who's going to be there tomorrow?
m:I'm not so sure I agree with you there.
m:Cool, I should really go tell that to them.
m:Maybe you've been here a little too long...
m:Hey, let's go join the group over there.
m:Maybe another time?
m:That could be true.
m:You're coming off a little strong
m:I'm not sure why you're telling me this.
m:That's cool...
m:I'll be sure to pass that on.
m:What did you say?
m:Oh?
m:Really...
m:I guess so?
m:I'm not sure what you mean.
m:That is one way to look at it.
m:Um...
m:I'm not so sure...
m:...heh.
m:What?
m:Ok.
m:Yeah ok.
m:Maybe.
m:Are you sure?
m:Maybe you want to rephrase that?
m:Wait, what?
m:Oh, I see.
m:Huh.
m:...*nervous laugh*
m:That might work?
m:Right...
b:I really thought better of you than that.
b:How could you say that to me?
b:Oh no, that won't be a good idea.
b:I'm definitely busy after this.
b:Are you kidding me?
b:That's awful.
b:Please back off.
b:I don't appreciate that.
b:Get out of my face.
b:You need to leave me alone.
b:I don't want to go out with you... ever.
b:This is going nowhere.
b:You really want to keep bothering me?
b:It would be great if you walked away now.
b:Oh wow, you're kind of terrible.
b:You're awfully forward.
b:Why are you trying so hard?
b:This isn't working.
b:Get away from me!
b:You're about as effective as a cat in a tree.
b:I told you not to say that!
b:Um... not really.
b:No one is appreciating this.
b:Be quiet.
b:Don't talk to me.
b:Please leave.
b:Stop talking to me.
b:I'm going to go talk with my friends now.
b:I'm going to go get another drink, don't follow me.
b:We are totally never going to hang out together.
b:Gonna just smack that offer of friendship off the table.
b:You really don't get it, do you?
b:If you think that, I think we're done talking.
b:This is a terrible way to make an impression.
b:You really just said that, didn't you?
b:Oh wow. No.
b:I'm not so thrilled to be here.
b:Do I look happy right now?
b:This conversation is over.
b:Don't bother.
b:I'm going to stop you right there.
b:You're very wrong.
b:No.
b:Ugh, no.
b:That's really not ok.
b:...
b:...stop.
b:Could you just not?
b:I have no words for how bad that was.
b:Oh god no.
b:Rude!
b:So rude!
b:I don't want to hear it.
b:Why would you do that?
b:*a shocked stare brimming with resentment*
b:Get out.
b:You are making me uncomfortable.
b:This is not ok.
b:No!
b:What did you say?!
b:I really don't like you.
b:Take that back.
b:Absolutely not.
