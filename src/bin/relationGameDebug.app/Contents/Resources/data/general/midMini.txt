m:Do you really think so?
m:Are you sure about that?
m:Maybe we could talk about something happier....
m:I'm not sure about that but alright.
m:You always say the weirdest things.
m:My plans might be open...
m:Tomorrow? What's going on then?
m:I can never tell what you'll say next!
m:Please think about what you said.
m:Just yesterday you said you wouldn't.
m:What did you say to me?
m:I didn't know you felt that way.
m:Is that what you really wanted to say to me?
m:Maybe we should do a rain check...
m:Oh, that could be fun.
m:Are you feeling ok?
m:Let's go chat with our friends for now, ok?
m:You know I don't think that.
m:Oh sure, that might work again.
m:I can grab us some more drinks.
m:Oh, um... let me think on that, ok?
m:Did I catch you at a bad time?
m:Some people might approach it like that.
m:Oh god, that is one way to take it haha.
m:That is interesting...
m:Oh yeah, maybe!
m:Uh huh, oh yeah?
m:Haha, hold up a second there...
m:No wait, really?
m:I think I should check in on my friend
m:I'm going to grab another drink soon...
m:Who's going to be there tomorrow?
m:I'm not so sure I agree with you there.
m:Cool, I should really go tell that to them.
m:Maybe you've been here a little too long...
m:Hey, let's go join the group over there.
m:Maybe another time?
m:That could be true.
m:You're coming off a little strong
m:I'm not sure why you're telling me this.
m:That's cool...
m:I'll be sure to pass that on.
m:What did you say?
m:Oh?
m:Really...
m:I guess so?
m:I'm not sure what you mean.
m:That is one way to look at it.
m:Um...
m:I'm not so sure...
m:...heh.
m:What?
m:Ok.
m:Yeah ok.
m:Maybe.
m:Are you sure?
m:Maybe you want to rephrase that?
m:Wait, what?

m:Huh.
m:...*nervous laugh*
m:That might work?
m:Right...
